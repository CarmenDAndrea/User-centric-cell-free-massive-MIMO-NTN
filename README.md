# User-centric-cell-free-massive-MIMO-NTN
This Matlab code computed the SINR per user and symbol for user-centric cell-free massive MIMO non terrestrial networks with OTFS and OFDM modulations
The main file for the computation of SINR is Main_SINR_evaluation.m where a number of simulation setting parameters can be chosen.
